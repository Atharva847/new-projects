    "The Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms:\n",

    "Bootstrap Sampling (Bagging): Random Forests build each tree on a random sample (with replacement) of the training data, which reduces the variance in the model's predictions by averaging multiple trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Randomness: When splitting a node, Random Forests randomly select a subset of features, which ensures that the trees are less correlated with each other and thus, reduces the risk of overfitting to the training data.\n",

    "n_estimators: The number of decision trees in the forest. Increasing this typically improves performance but also increases computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "max_depth: The maximum depth of each tree. Limiting the depth can prevent overfitting by controlling how complex each tree can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Higher values prevent the model from learning overly specific patterns.\n",

    "max_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split. A lower number of features increases the randomness and generally improves performance by reducing overfitting.\n",
