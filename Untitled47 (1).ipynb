    "Q1. What is a contingency matrix, and how is it used to evaluate the performance of a classification model?\n",
    "A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix in the context of classification, is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels.\n",

    "Q2. How is a pair confusion matrix different from a regular confusion matrix, and why might it be useful in certain situations?\n",
    "A pair confusion matrix is used in clustering evaluation to assess the agreement between two sets of cluster assignments (e.g., the true labels and the predicted clusters). It focuses on pairs of instances rather than individual instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: The matrix compares all possible pairs of instances and classifies them as:\n",
    "\n",
    "True Positive (TP): Both instances in the pair are in the same cluster in both the true and predicted labels.\n",
    "True Negative (TN): Both instances in the pair are in different clusters in both the true and predicted labels.\n",
    "False Positive (FP): The instances are in the same cluster in the predicted labels but not in the true labels.\n",
    "False Negative (FN): The instances are in the same cluster in the true labels but not in the predicted labels.\n",
    "Usefulness: It is particularly useful for evaluating clustering algorithms because it considers the relationships between pairs of data points, providing a more detailed understanding of the clustering performance compared to a regular confusion matrix.\n",
