    "Clustering algorithms can be broadly categorized into several types, each with distinct approaches and assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: K-means, K-medoids.\n",
    "Approach: These methods divide the dataset into a predefined number of clusters. K-means, for instance, partitions data based on distance to cluster centroids.\n",

    "Hierarchical Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Agglomerative clustering, Divisive clustering.\n",

    "Assumptions: Clusters can have arbitrary shapes and sizes.\n",
    "Density-Based Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: DBSCAN, OPTICS.\n",
    "Approach: Clusters are formed based on the density of data points. Areas of high density are separated by areas of low density.\n",

    "Model-Based Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).\n",
    "Approach: These methods assume that data is generated from a mixture of several probability distributions and cluster assignments are based on likelihood.\n",
    "Assumptions: Clusters can be of various shapes based on the underlying distribution.\n",
    "Grid-Based Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: STING, CLIQUE.\n",
